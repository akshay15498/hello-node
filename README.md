# Project Name: Kubernetes Deployment and Monitoring with PostgreSQL #
# Overview
This project aims to deploy a Node.js application on a local Kubernetes cluster, implement autoscaling, stress testing, and monitoring using Grafana and Prometheus. Additionally, PostgreSQL is deployed within the cluster with a focus on data persistence and monitoring.

# Kubernetes Deployment
* Prepare Node.js Codebase
* Ensure your Node.js application is containerized using Docker.
* Create a Kubernetes deployment manifest (deployment.yaml) for your Node.js application. Define the container image, ports, environment variables, and any other necessary configurations.
* Apply the deployment manifest to your local Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml.
