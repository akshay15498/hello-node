# Project Name: Kubernetes Deployment and Monitoring with PostgreSQL #

Overview and Description:

Start with a brief overview of your project and its purpose.
Describe the technologies used (e.g., Node.js, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus) and their roles in the project.

# Prerequisites:

List the prerequisites needed to run the deployment locally, such as:
Docker installed and configured
Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube) running locally
Helm installed for managing Kubernetes resources (if applicable)
Access to Docker Hub or a private Docker registry (if pushing Docker images)

# Project Structure:
Describe the structure of your project directory, highlighting key files and directories relevant to deployment and configuration (e.g., Dockerfile, Kubernetes YAML files, Helm charts).

# Deployment Instructions:
Provide step-by-step instructions for running the deployment locally:
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone <repository_url>.
Navigate to the project directory: cd <project_directory>.
Build the Docker image for your Node.js application:
docker build -t <image_name> .
Run the Docker container locally:
docker run -p 3000:3000 <image_name>
Verify that your Node.js application is running by accessing http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
If applicable, provide additional instructions for setting up PostgreSQL locally, deploying Prometheus and Grafana locally, and accessing monitoring dashboards.
